				<h2>
					Structure
				</h2>
				<div class = "bodytext">
				<p>
					We are a society of students who share common interests in math and beyond. Our primary department is Applied Math, but is by no means limited to it. The political structure of USAM centers around a small executive team of dedicated members.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Goals
				</h2>
				<div class = "bodytext">
				<p>
					We will strive to engage students with current research within the department and provide an education where their skills are applicable outside the classroom. We wish to create an environment in the department that both students and faculty can be proud of and benefit from. We will organize several events throughout the year to help students connect with each other and faculty.  Secondary goals include promoting Applied Math to potential students, maintaining communication with faculty and students to improve our role within the department, and keeping students informed of competitions, events, volunteer opportunities, and any other news that may be useful to them.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Events 
				</h2>
				<div class = "bodytext">
				<p>
					We hold regular events, such as seminars, where students are invited to either socialize or learn something new.<br><br>

					Furthermore, we will host a variety of events throughout the year, from seminars to simple gatherings where students can have a chance to meet and socialize. We'll also give students the opportunity to meet professors in the department.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h2>
					Constitution

				<div class = "bodytext">
